Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.

## OBJECTIVES:<br>
To identify if the movie review is positive or negative.

## STEPS:<br>
1.Get Tensor Flow dataset on IMDb reviews .<br>
2.Classify the data and store them as training and testing data <br>
3.Design the model <br>
4.Building the model <br>
5.Train the Model <br>
6.Plot grap of accuracy vs epochs and loss vs epochs <br>

## HOW EASY IT IS TO GET STARTED:
1.Open the file IMDb review.ipynb<br>
2.Click open in Google Colaboratory<br>
3.Starting from the top press Shift+enter to run a cell.<br>
4.When a cell stops running the result is displayed. <br>
5.When last cell is processed it will download a "vecs.tsv" and "meta.tsv" file <br>
6.Now go to http://projector.tensorflow.org/ and click on load<br>
7.First choose the "vecs.tsv" then "meta.tsv"<br>
8.Now click on sphereize data and boom the most used words in positive and negative reviews get seperated.<br>
9.This helps the ai detect if the review is positive or negative.
